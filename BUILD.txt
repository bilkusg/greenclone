This project was built using VS2010 and .net framework 4.5
Other versions of the microsoft tools and framework will probably work too
The supplied .sln and .csproj files may work, but I don't support them, just the actual code.

If the supplied .sln doesn't work for some reason, you can easily create a new project for the 4 .cs files. 

The only gotchas are:

You either need to strip out the VSS stuff ( see below ) or have the AlphaVSS dlls which you can get either from the binary distribution of greenclone
or from the www.alphaleonis.com website. Then you need to add references to AlphaVSS.Common.dll and have the other AlphaVSS files in the directory you run from.
Alphavss dynamically loads one of the other dlls depending on the platform you are running on.
Your target must be 'Any CPU' not x86 if you are running on a 64 bit machine. This is a limitation of VSS implementations.


If you want to strip out the VSS stuff it's all easier to compile. Just remove vsshelper.cs and delete the couple of lines which refer to it in clone.cs
